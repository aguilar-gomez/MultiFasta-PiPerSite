# MultiFasta-PiPerSite
 
Calculates nucleotide diversity (pi) per site from a multiple sequence alignment fasta file.

Usage: multifasta2perSitePi.py MSA.fasta

Supply a multiple sequence alignment fasta file as the first argument and the script outputs a file with n lines where n is the sequence length and each row is the average number of pairwise differences in each site. It also outputs a plot with the value of pi along the sequence.
